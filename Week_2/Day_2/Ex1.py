# 🌟 Exercise 1: Pets

# Instructions
# Use the provided Pets and Cat classes to create a Siamese breed, instantiate cat objects, and use the Pets class to manage them.
# See the example below, before diving in.

# Step 1: Create the Siamese Class
# Create a class called Siamese that inherits from the Cat class.
# You can add any specific attributes or methods for the Siamese breed, or leave it as is if there are no unique behaviors.

# Step 2: Create a List of Cat Instances
# Create a list called all_cats that contains instances of Bengal, Chartreux, and Siamese cats.
# Example: all_cats = [bengal_obj, chartreux_obj, siamese_obj]
# Give each cat a name and age.

# Step 3: Create a Pets Instance
# Create an instance of the Pets class called sara_pets, passing the all_cats list as an argument.

# Step 4: Take Cats for a Walk
# Call the walk() method on the sara_pets instance.
# This should print the result of calling the walk() method on each cat in the list.

# Step 1: Create the Siamese class
# Step 2: Create a list of cat instances
# Step 3: Create a Pets instance of the list of cat instances

# sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)
# Step 4: Take cats for a walk
# sara_pets.walk()
